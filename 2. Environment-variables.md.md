# Hands-on Linux-02 : Linux Environment Variables

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to teach the students how to use environment variables.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- explain environment variables.

- understand Quoting with Variables.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Common Environment Variables & Accessing Variable

- Part 2 - Path Variable

- Part 3 - Quoting with Variables

- Part 4 - Sudo Command

## Part 1 - Common Environment/Shell Variables & Accessing Variable
​
- Variables can be classified into two main categories, `environment variables`, and `shell variables`. 

- `Shell variables` are valid in the current shell instance.

-  `Environment variables` are variables that are valid system-wide.


### Shell Variables

- A variable is pointer to the actual data. The shell enables us to create, assign, and delete variables.

- The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character (_) and beginning with a letter or underscore character.

- The following examples are valid variable names.

```bash
KEY=value
_VAR=5
clarus_way=test
```

> Note that there is no space on either side of the equals ( = ) sign. 

- The following examples are invalid.

```bash
3_KEY=value
-VAR=5
clarus-way=test
KEY_1?=value1
```

- The reason we cannot use other characters such as `?`, `*`, or `-` is that these characters have a special meaning for the shell.

### Environment Variables

- Environment variables allow you to customize how the system works and the behavior of the applications on the system.

- We can see a list of all of our environmental variables by using the env or printenv commands.

```bash
printenv
env
```

#### Difference between "env" and "printenv" commands. 

- The difference between the two commands is that with `printenv`, you can request the values of individual variables:

```bash
printenv HOME
echo $HOME
env HOME
```
​
- To get a list of all shell variables, environmental variables and shell functions, type the `set` command.

```bash
set
```

- Create an environment variable with `export` command.

```bash
export ENVVAR=value
env
```
​
- Remove the environment  or shell variable with unset command.
​
```bash
export ENVVAR=value
env | grep ENVVAR
unset ENVVAR
env | grep ENVVAR
```
